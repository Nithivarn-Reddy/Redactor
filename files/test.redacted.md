This is █ . Where 's Papa going with that ax ? `` said █ to █ █ as they were setting the table for breakfast . `` Out to the hoghouse , `` replied Mrs. █ . `` Some pigs were born last night . `` `` I do n't see why █ needs an ax , `` continued █ , who was only eight . `` Well , `` said █ █ , `` one of the pigs is a runt . It 's very small and weak , and it will never amount to anything . So your █ has decided to do away with it . `` `` Do away with it ? `` shrieked █ . `` You mean kill it ? Just because it 's smaller than the others ? `` Mrs. █ put a pitcher of cream on the table . `` Do n't yell , █ ! `` █ said . `` Your █ is right . The pig-girl would probably die anyway . `` █ pushed a chair out of the way and ran outdoors . The grass was wet and the earth smelled of springtime . █ 's sneakers were sopping by the time █ caught up with █ █ . █ 's Web `` Please do n't kill it ! `` █ sobbed . `` It 's unfair . `` █ █ stopped walking . `` █ , `` █ said gently , `` you will have to learn to control yourself . `` Control yourself fangirl . yelled █ . `` This is a matter of life and death , and you talk about controlling myself . `` █ ran down █ cheeks and █ took hold of the ax and tried to pull it out of █ █ 's hand . `` █ , `` said █ █ , `` I know more about raising a litter of pigs than you do . A weakling makes trouble . Now run along ! `` `` But it 's unfair , `` cried █ . `` The pig could n't help being born small , could it ? If I had been very small at birth , would you have killed me ? `` █ █ smiled . `` Certainly not , `` █ said , looking down at █ █ with love . `` But this is different . A little █ is one thing , a little runty pig is another . `` `` I see no difference , `` replied █ , still hanging on to the ax . Made on █ . █ , 0012.12.1
